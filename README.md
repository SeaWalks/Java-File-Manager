# To do list (Based off lab instructions)

 - [x] Start with the main frame. I will provide some videos on how to use Java Swing classes.

 - [ ] Develop the desktop pane. I will do a video.
 - [ ] Develop the tree side first (left). Then do the file list(right).
 - [ ] Figure out the multiple frame concepts. I will do a video.
